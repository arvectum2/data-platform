# Data Platform migration roadmap

Date: 2026-10-04

Legend: [x] done, [ ] ready/planned.

## Current state

- [x] Separate arvectum2/data-platform repository exists and mirrors to GitVerse.
- [x] Reuse audit of Discount Parser and Tender Agent completed.
- [x] Data Platform v1 product boundary fixed.
- [x] Search architecture fixed: scoped hybrid retrieval, evidence-first, PostgreSQL FTS + pgvector production backend.
- [x] Migration strategy fixed: compatibility/strangler migration, no big-bang rewrite.
- [x] Generic platform code has been promoted from Discount Parser into src/arvectum_data.
- [x] No blockers remain for the platform foundation.

## DP-FND-001 — repository/package foundation

Status: COMPLETE.

- [x] create pyproject.toml for arvectum-data / arvectum_data;
- [x] Python 3.11+ baseline;
- [x] ruff/pytest;
- [x] CI;
- [x] FastAPI service shell with /health;
- [x] ARVECTUM_DATA_ settings;
- [x] structured logging;
- [x] versioning/dev commands.

Gate: clean checkout -> install -> pytest -> /health = ok.

## DP-MIG-001 — promote generic extraction engine

Status: COMPLETE.

Source: discount-parser/arvectum_data.

- [x] move package with traceable source revision;
- [x] move focused tests/dp_engine platform coverage;
- [x] exclude product-coupled acceptance/parity tests from the platform suite;
- [x] preserve public Python imports;
- [x] reproduce acquisition/crawl/extraction/multi-record/persistence/review/execution behavior;
- [x] establish Data Platform repository as canonical implementation;
- [x] make Discount Parser consume arvectum-data pinned to canonical commit a591256;
- [x] run product regressions: 289 DP-engine tests and 634 full product tests passed;
- [x] remove duplicate only after acceptance; Discount Parser commit e0e3039.

Gate: promoted tests green and offline URL/HTML extraction works end-to-end without Discount Parser imports.

## DP-DOC-001 — generic document ingestion

Status: COMPLETE.

Reuse document_text_extractor, safe format handling and chunker from Tender Agent.

- [x] Resource, Document and Chunk contracts;
- [x] TXT/HTML/PDF/DOCX/XLSX extraction;
- [x] deterministic chunking;
- [x] content-hash/idempotency;
- [x] provenance from resource to chunk.

Gate: file/url -> Resource -> Document -> Chunk[] -> evidence without procurement models.

## DP-EMB-001 — embedding provider abstraction

Status: COMPLETE.

- [x] move provider protocol/errors;
- [x] deterministic hashing provider;
- [x] local embedding HTTP/llama provider;
- [x] decouple configuration from Tender Agent;
- [x] model/dimension identity;
- [x] batch interface;
- [x] health probe.

## DP-STORE-001 — canonical PostgreSQL schema

Status: COMPLETE.

- [x] Alembic;
- [x] collections/resources/documents/records/chunks;
- [x] provenance;
- [x] actual pgvector embedding storage with per-row dimension metadata;
- [x] ingest/index runs;
- [x] active index revision;
- [x] collection isolation constraints.

Gate: empty PostgreSQL + pgvector -> migrate -> ingest/retrieve fixture.

## DP-LEX-001 — lexical backend

Status: COMPLETE.

- [x] LexicalBackend protocol;
- [x] PostgreSQL FTS backend;
- [x] Russian/English/simple strategy with generated tsvector columns;
- [x] phrase/token FTS plus deterministic exact-phrase boost;
- [x] metadata filters with fail-closed whitelist;
- [x] in-memory test backend;
- [x] lexical acceptance fixtures including live PostgreSQL Russian search.

True BM25 is deferred until benchmarks show PostgreSQL FTS is insufficient.

## DP-VEC-001 — production pgvector backend

- [ ] VectorIndex protocol;
- [x] keep JSON/local backend for dev/tests;
- [x] pgvector storage/query;
- [x] collection-scoped vector query;
- [ ] measured HNSW/IVFFlat decision;
- [ ] model/dimension migration safety;
- [x] PostgreSQL integration tests.

Gate: no production search path depends on JsonVectorStore.

## DP-SEARCH-001 — hybrid retrieval

Status: COMPLETE (v1 deterministic hybrid).

- [x] SearchQuery / SearchHit;
- [x] lexical candidates;
- [x] vector candidates;
- [x] RRF fusion;
- [x] metadata/security filters;
- [x] stable tie breaking;
- [x] evidence/provenance projection;
- [x] optional product ranker hook;
- [x] component lexical/vector/fusion scores are always exposed for explainability.

Gate: lexical and vector retrieval run simultaneously, collection isolation is enforced, every hit has evidence, and hybrid quality is benchmarked against both single retrievers.

## DP-API-001 — service v1

Status: COMPLETE.

- [x] collections API;
- [x] ingest URL/document API;
- [x] extraction API;
- [x] search API;
- [x] durable index rebuild jobs/status with revision + metrics;
- [x] request IDs/basic service metrics;
- [x] internal API-key auth boundary;
- [x] OpenAPI contract tests.

## DP-CONN-001 — connector SDK + generic web discovery

Status: COMPLETE.

- [x] discover/fetch protocols;
- [x] registry;
- [x] manual URL;
- [x] sitemap-first discovery with bounded site-crawl fallback;
- [x] generic web search via product-neutral DuckDuckGo Lite connector;
- [x] rate limit/retry policy;
- [x] SSRF/private-network guard including redirect validation for connector HTTP;
- [x] connector health/status registry and /v1/connectors API;
- [x] /v1/discover service API.

44-FZ/223-FZ/EIS stay product-specific initially.

## DP-INT-001 — Tender Agent migration

First production consumer.

Status: CODE INTEGRATION MERGED; runtime rollout and production acceptance pending.

Merged in Tender Agent PR #144 (cbd5275).

- [x] compatibility adapter from Tender RAG to Data Platform;
- [x] preserve Tender Agent as canonical owner of procurement chunks while using Data Platform pre-chunked ingestion;
- [x] migrate embedding/index path to Data Platform when the data_platform backend is selected;
- [x] replace vector-first/lexical-fallback retrieval with collection-scoped hybrid search;
- [x] preserve procurement filters, citation mapping and human-control boundaries;
- [x] run Tender Research regression suite and Tender Operator demo regressions;
- [x] verify live cross-repository ingest -> pgvector/FTS -> hybrid search -> Tender citation mapping;
- [x] fail closed when the current versioned Data Platform collection is absent/incomplete;
- [ ] deploy/supervise the Data Platform service in the Tender runtime;
- [ ] prepare/reindex real pilot tender(s) against the Data Platform backend;
- [ ] switch Tender runtime to AI_CORP_RAG_RETRIEVAL_BACKEND=data_platform;
- [ ] compare production retrieval quality, citations and latency against the legacy backend;
- [ ] remove duplicate legacy JSON-vector/generic retrieval code only after production acceptance.

Code gate passed: existing Tender Agent workflows and CI remain green, and normal retrieval is scoped to one deterministic versioned collection per tender. Production gate remains the controlled runtime rollout above.

## DP-INT-002 — Arvectum OS RAG migration

- [ ] inventory current knowledge/RAG interfaces;
- [ ] map sources to collections;
- [ ] ingest knowledge assets;
- [ ] switch retrieval to /v1/search;
- [ ] preserve access boundaries;
- [ ] evaluate evidence and latency.

## DP-INT-003 — Growth / SEO consumer

- [ ] arvectum.com site collection;
- [ ] app/product metadata collections;
- [ ] competitor/research collection;
- [ ] web discovery workflow;
- [ ] crawl/index change detection;
- [ ] Growth Agent Search API client;
- [ ] provenance-backed results.

## DP-OPS-001 — operational hardening

- [ ] idempotent ingest/index jobs;
- [ ] atomic index revision switch;
- [ ] retry/dead-letter policy;
- [ ] source/index freshness;
- [ ] ingest/search metrics;
- [ ] secret-free diagnostics;
- [ ] backup/restore;
- [ ] capacity guardrails.

## Post-v1 backlog

Only after three real consumers are integrated:

- [ ] entity resolution;
- [ ] entity graph/relations;
- [ ] benchmark-driven BM25 backend if needed;
- [ ] learned reranker;
- [ ] optional bounded LLM reranking;
- [ ] query expansion;
- [ ] distributed crawling;
- [ ] authorized federated cross-collection search;
- [ ] relevance feedback/evaluation pipeline.

## Definition of done

Every phase requires implementation in canonical data-platform, focused tests, affected-consumer regression verification, preserved provenance/security invariants, updated docs, a canonical commit, and duplicate removal only after consumer acceptance.

The first code task is deliberately not “write a new search engine”. It is to promote the mature extraction foundation into its canonical repository, then build the missing search layers around real consumer requirements.
